# Overview
The following projects show how to use the arabic fonts.

# Usage
This example shows how to correctly render the arabic strings.

Here are the steps to do it:
1. First of all, you must have a font containing the characters of the unicode block called `Arabic Presentation
Forms-B` i.e. the range `0xFE70-0xFEFF`.
2. Then your strings must be formed with the characters of this range too (as you
can see with the strings of HowToUseArabicFontDisplayable.TITLE and HowToUseArabicFontDisplayable.AVAILABLE_TEXTS, /u0020 corresponds to the space character).
3. Finally the order of the strings must be reversed.
